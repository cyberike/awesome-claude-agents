The `/enroll` and `/recognize` endpoints handle the core functionality, while the `/face` endpoints allow for managing the enrolled faces.\n\nThe actual implementation would involve selecting appropriate algorithms, databases, and frameworks to build out this design. I've also noted some additional engineering considerations that would need to be fleshed out.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this API design!"

      "output": "To implement a crypto donation endpoint, we'll need to set up a few components. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can approach this:\n\n1. Choose a cryptocurrency payment processor or API:\n   - Select a reliable and widely-used payment processor or API that supports the cryptocurrencies you want to accept for donations.\n   - Some popular options include Coinbase Commerce, BitPay, or Stripe with its cryptocurrency support.\n\n2. Set up an account with the chosen payment processor:\n   - Sign up for an account with the selected payment processor.\n   - Configure your account settings, including the cryptocurrencies you want to accept and the wallet addresses where you want to receive the donations.\n\n3. Integrate the payment processor into your backend:\n   - Use the API or SDK provided by the payment processor to integrate it into your backend code.\n   - This typically involves making API requests to create invoices, retrieve payment statuses, and handle webhook notifications.\n\n4. Create a donation endpoint in your backend:\n   - Implement an API endpoint in your backend that will handle the donation requests.\n   - This endpoint should accept the necessary parameters such as the donation amount, the selected cryptocurrency, and any additional metadata.\n\n5. Process the donation request:\n   - When a donation request is received, use the payment processor's API to create an invoice or payment request.\n   - Pass the required parameters, such as the donation amount and the selected cryptocurrency, to the payment processor.\n   - The payment processor will provide a unique payment URL or a QR code that can be presented to the user.\n\n6. Display the payment instructions to the user:\n   - Once you receive the payment URL or QR code from the payment processor, display it to the user on the frontend.\n   - Provide clear instructions on how the user can complete the payment using their cryptocurrency wallet.\n\n7. Handle payment confirmations and updates:\n   - Set up webhook endpoints to receive payment confirmations and updates from the payment processor.\n   - When a payment is confirmed, update your database or perform any necessary actions, such as sending a confirmation email to the donor.\n\n8. Test and deploy:\n   - Thoroughly test the donation endpoint to ensure it functions correctly and securely.\n   - Deploy the updated code to your production environment.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how the donation endpoint might look in Express.js:\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/donate', async (req, res) => {\n  const { amount, currency } = req.body;\n\n  try {\n    // Create an invoice using the payment processor's API\n    const invoice = await paymentProcessor.createInvoice(amount, currency);\n\n    // Return the payment URL or QR code to the frontend\n    res.json({ paymentUrl: invoice.url });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error creating donation invoice:', error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to create donation invoice' });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nRemember to handle security aspects, such as validating and sanitizing user input, securing sensitive information like API keys, and complying with any legal requirements related to cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nAdditionally, provide clear documentation and instructions to users on how to make a donation using cryptocurrencies, including any necessary disclaimers or terms of service."

      "agent": "frontend_developer",
      "status": "completed",
      "output": "To build a login screen with facial scan functionality, you'll need to use a facial recognition library or API. One popular choice is the Face Recognition library in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide to building a login screen with facial scan using Python and the Face Recognition library:\n\n1. Install the required libraries:\n   - Install Python on your system if you haven't already.\n   - Install the Face Recognition library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n     ```\n     pip install face_recognition\n     ```\n   - Install the necessary GUI library, such as Tkinter, by running:\n     ```\n     pip install tkinter\n     ```\n\n2. Capture and encode the user's face:\n   - Use a webcam or camera module to capture an image of the user's face during the registration process.\n   - Use the Face Recognition library to detect and encode the face in the captured image.\n   - Store the encoded face data along with the corresponding user details in a database or file.\n\n3. Create the login screen:\n   - Use a GUI library like Tkinter to create the login screen interface.\n   - Add a button or trigger to initiate the facial scan process.\n\n4. Implement the facial scan functionality:\n   - When the user clicks the facial scan button, capture an image from the camera.\n   - Use the Face Recognition library to detect and encode the face in the captured image.\n   - Compare the encoded face with the stored face encodings associated with registered users.\n   - If a match is found, grant access and proceed to the next screen or perform the desired action.\n   - If no match is found, display an error message or prompt the user to try again.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\nimport cv2\n\n# Capture and encode the user's face during registration\ndef register_face():\n    # Code to capture the user's face using a camera\n    # Encode the captured face using face_recognition library\n    # Store the encoded face data along with user details in a database or file\n    pass\n\n# Perform facial scan for login\ndef facial_scan():\n    # Capture an image from the camera\n    camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)\n    ret, frame = camera.read()\n    camera.release()\n\n    # Encode the captured face\n    face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(frame)\n\n    if len(face_encodings) > 0:\n        # Compare the encoded face with stored face encodings\n        # Code to retrieve stored face encodings from the database or file\n        stored_encodings = []  # Placeholder for stored face encodings\n\n        match = face_recognition.compare_faces(stored_encodings, face_encodings[0])\n\n        if True in match:\n            messagebox.showinfo(\"Login Success\", \"Facial scan matched. Access granted.\")\n        else:\n            messagebox.showerror(\"Login Failed\", \"Facial scan did not match. Access denied.\")\n    else:\n        messagebox.showerror(\"Login Failed\", \"No face detected. Please try again.\")\n\n# Create the login screen\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Login with Facial Scan\")\n\n# Create and pack the widgets\nlabel = tk.Label(root, text=\"Click the button to perform facial scan\")\nlabel.pack()\n\nbutton = tk.Button(root, text=\"Facial Scan\", command=facial_scan)\nbutton.pack()\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nNote: This is a simplified example and may require additional code and modifications based on your specific requirements, such as integrating with a database for storing user information and handling user registration.\n\nRemember to handle security considerations, such as securely storing face encodings, implementing proper authentication mechanisms, and obtaining user consent for facial recognition."

      "output": "To implement user verification, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a user registration form that collects necessary user information such as username, email, and password.\n\n2. When the user submits the registration form, validate the input data on the server-side to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., username and email are unique, password meets complexity requirements).\n\n3. If the input data is valid, securely hash the user's password using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2. Store the hashed password in the database along with the user's other information.\n\n4. Send a verification email to the user's registered email address. The email should contain a unique verification link or token.\n\n5. When the user clicks on the verification link or enters the verification token, mark the user's account as verified in the database.\n\n6. Implement a login system that allows verified users to authenticate using their credentials (e.g., username/email and password).\n\n7. During the login process, compare the user-provided password with the hashed password stored in the database.
