    "result": "Here are a few suggestions for monitoring distressed real estate listings in Lea County, Santa Fe, and Albuquerque, New Mexico:\n\n1. Set up alerts on real estate websites: \n- Create saved searches on sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin etc. for foreclosures, short-sales, and other distressed properties in your target markets\n- Set the alerts to email you daily or instant notifications when new listings match your criteria\n\n2. Check county public records:\n- Visit the county assessor and recorder websites for Lea, Santa Fe, and Bernalillo (Albuquerque) counties \n- Look for Notices of Default, Notices of Trustee Sale, and REO (bank-owned) property lists\n- These provide advance notice of properties potentially heading to foreclosure auction\n\n3. Network with local real estate agents:\n- Develop relationships with agents in Hobbs, Lovington, Santa Fe, Albuquerque who specialize in distressed properties\n- They often know of upcoming listings before they hit the market and can alert you\n\n4. Drive for dollars:\n- Physically drive through neighborhoods looking for distressed properties \n- Signs can include overgrown yards, accumulated newspapers, code violation notices, etc.\n- Write down the addresses and research the owner information to contact them\n\n5. Attend foreclosure auctions:\n- Find out when and where foreclosure auctions occur in each county \n- Attend the auctions to bid on properties and observe which ones don't sell and become REOs\n- Auctions are often held on the county courthouse steps\n\n6. Subscribe to a foreclosure listing service:\n- Services like RealtyTrac, Auction.com, and ForeclosureRadar consolidate listings from multiple sources\n- You can search by county and property type and set up alerts\n- There is usually a monthly or annual subscription fee\n\nThe key is to monitor listings across multiple channels and act quickly when distressed properties match your buying criteria in those New Mexico markets. Setting up automated alerts will help you stay on top of new opportunities."

    "result": "Here are some steps to identify tax delinquent or auctioned properties suitable for Rehab-2-Rental or Subject-to strategies:\n\n1. Search public records and tax assessor websites for properties with delinquent taxes or scheduled for tax auction in your target markets. Look for properties that are at least 2-3 years behind on taxes.\n\n2. Analyze the property details to determine if it fits your buying criteria in terms of location, property type, after repair value (ARV), needed repairs, etc. Focus on properties in B/C class neighborhoods that could cashflow well as rentals after being rehabbed.\n\n3. Drive by the property to get a sense of its condition and the surrounding neighborhood. Take note of the level of repairs needed and if it's currently occupied or vacant. Vacant properties may be easier to acquire.\n\n4. Research who owns the property by looking up the deed records. Try to get contact information for the owner if possible. \n\n5. If it's going to tax auction, attend the auction to potentially bid on it. Be sure to do your due diligence on the property condition, title status, and your maximum allowable offer ahead of time.\n\n6. If it's tax delinquent but not in auction yet, attempt to contact the owner about buying their property and taking over the back taxes owed. Position it as a win-win to relieve them of the tax burden.\n\n7. For occupied properties, you could approach the owner about buying it \"Subject-to\" the existing financing in place. This allows you to take over their mortgage payments in exchange for the deed.\n\n8. Once under contract, do a full financial analysis on the deal. Estimate the repair costs, ARV, and rental comps to determine if you can achieve your desired cash-on-cash return.\n\n9. If the numbers work, proceed with closing on the deal and executing your Rehab-2-Rental conversion or taking over the Subject-to payments. Have property management lined up to handle the rental.\n\nThe keys are to find distressed properties with motivated sellers, crunch the numbers carefully, and negotiate great deals. Tax delinquent and auctioned properties can provide some of the best opportunities if analyzed properly. Let me know if you have any other questions!"

    "result": "Here are a few key things I would consider when evaluating a property's details, pricing and potential:\n\nLocation - The old real estate adage \"location, location, location\" still holds true. Consider the neighborhood, proximity to amenities, schools, jobs, transportation, etc. A great location is one of the most important factors in a property's value and appreciation potential.\n\nCondition - Carefully assess the current condition of the property. Are major systems like the roof, HVAC, plumbing and electrical in good shape or will they need expensive repairs/replacement? Overall condition impacts value.\n\nMarket comparables - Look at recent sale prices for similar properties in the area to gauge if the listing price is in line with the market. Consider things like price per square foot compared to other properties.\n\nRental potential - If you plan to rent out the property, research rents for comparable properties in the area and calculate the potential cash flow and return on investment. The 1% rule (monthly rent \u2265 1% of purchase price) is one guideline some investors use.\n\nAppreciation potential - Look at historical price appreciation for the area and try to gauge future prospects. Is the area up-and-coming with new development that could drive prices up? Or already mature and built-out?\n\nFinancing - Consider your financing options and costs. What will your monthly payment be with a given downpayment? Is it a cash flow positive investment?\n\nRisks - Assess potential downsides and risks - things like environmental hazards, flood zones, high crime areas, depreciating areas, etc. that could hurt the property's value.\n\nOpportunity cost - Compare the potential returns of the property to your other investment options to see if it's the best use of your capital.\n\nDue diligence - Dig into property records, disclosures, HOA docs, etc. and get a professional inspection to uncover any potential issues. Understand exactly what you're buying.\n\nYour criteria - Consider your own investment goals, risk tolerance and criteria. Does this property align with your personal strategy and needs?\n\nCarefully evaluating these factors and running the numbers can help determine if a property is a good investment at a given price point. Of course, there are always risks and unknowns in real estate. But thorough due diligence improves your odds of making a sound investment. Let me know if you have any other specific questions!"

    "result": "Here are a few suggestions for comparing prices and specs to find good deals:\n\n1. Make a list of the key specs and features that are most important to you. This could be things like screen size for a TV, storage capacity for a phone, horsepower for a car, etc. Prioritize your must-haves.\n\n2. Research and note the typical price ranges for products with your desired specs. Get a sense of what's considered entry-level, mid-range and high-end in terms of pricing for that category.\n\n3. Look for sales, promotions and discounts, especially on previous generation models when a new version is released. Buying last year's flagship product can often provide great value.\n\n4. Compare prices from multiple retailers and marketplaces. Don't forget to factor in things like taxes, shipping costs, and warranty terms. \n\n5. Read professional and customer reviews to gauge quality and long-term reliability, not just specs. A product that seems like a great value could have cut corners on build quality or customer support.\n\n6. Consider refurbished or open-box deals from reputable sellers. You can often save substantially compared to buying new, with little practical downside if the warranty and return policy are good.\n\n7. Assess your planned usage and buy for your real needs, not just the best specs. For example, don't overspend on a high-end GPU if you only play casual games. \n\n8. Be patient and willing to compromise on minor features. Waiting for a sale or being flexible on something like color can yield big savings.\n\nThe key is doing your research, knowing the market, and pouncing on short-lived deals when a product you want hits the right price relative to its specs and your needs. It takes some effort but can pay off substantially in the long run."

    "result": "Here is a high-level approach for integrating with the ATTOM API to pull property data:\n\n1. Sign up for an ATTOM API account and obtain API credentials (API key/token).\n\n2. Review the ATTOM API documentation to understand the available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements etc. The main documentation is available here: https://api.developer.attomdata.com/docs \n\n3. Determine which specific ATTOM API endpoints and datasets are needed to pull the required property data for the analyst to review. Some key ones may be:\n- Property API - Retrieve property details by address or geographic coordinates \n- Assessment API - Get assessed values, market values and tax amounts\n- Sale History API - Access detailed sale and transfer records\n- Area API - Get geographic boundaries and other area info\n\n4. Set up a backend service (e.g. Node.js, Python) that will handle making requests to the ATTOM API:\n- Use a HTTP client library to construct API requests, handling authentication by passing the API key/token\n- Make GET requests to the desired API endpoints, passing in required parameters like address or geographic coordinates  \n- Handle the JSON responses, parsing out the needed data fields\n- Implement error handling, logging and retry logic as needed\n\n5. Create a database (e.g. Postgres, MongoDB) to store the property data retrieved from ATTOM. Design an appropriate schema to hold the various data points.\n\n6. Extend the backend service to take the parsed API responses and write the data to the database. Handle database connection pooling, error handling etc.\n\n7. Set up a job scheduler (e.g. cron) to run the API polling on a regular basis to pull the latest property data into the database. Make it configurable to control the schedule.\n\n8. Create a frontend interface for the Analyst to be able to easily query and review the property data stored in the database. This could allow them to search by address, filter, sort, visualize trends etc.\n\n9. Add monitoring and alerting to detect any failures in the API polling job or database writes. \n\n10. Document the end-to-end integration and provide a runbook for common troubleshooting steps.\n\nHere's an example of making an API request to ATTOM using Node.js to get property details:\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nconst ATTOM_API_BASE = 'https://api.gateway.attomdata.com/propertyapi/v1.0.0';\n\nasync function getPropertyDetails(address, zipCode) {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get(`${ATTOM_API_BASE}/property/detail`, {\n      headers: {\n        'apikey': process.env.ATTOM_API_KEY\n      },\n      params: {\n        address,\n        zipcode: zipCode\n      }\n    });\n    \n    console.log(response.data);\n    // TODO: Extract desired fields and write to database\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(`Failed to get property details: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis provides a foundation to automate pulling property data from ATTOM. The specifics will depend on your exact data requirements, technology stack, scale and infrastructure. Let me know if you need any other details!"
