Build an interactive protein engineering copilot system that enables real-time collaboration between biologists and AI. The system should: 1) Allow biologists to specify desired protein functions 2) Have AI propose targeted mutations 3) Provide real-time visualization of structure-function tradeoffs 4) Include explainable AI features so scientists understand the reasoning 5) Create intuitive workflows that bridge the trust gap between domain experts and AI-designed proteins. Focus on making AI protein design accessible and trustworthy for wet lab researchers.
