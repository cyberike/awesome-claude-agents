## Task
Ensure all required tech stack elements are accounted for

**Status:** completed

### Output
```
Here are the steps I would take to ensure all required tech stack elements are accounted for:

1. Review the project requirements and specifications to understand what capabilities and functionality the application needs to have. Make a list of the key features.

2. For each major feature or capability, identify what technology components would be needed to implement it. This could include:
- Programming languages 
- Frameworks and libraries
- Databases 
- Web servers
- Caching systems
- Search engines
- Message queues 
- API gateways
- Container orchestration 
- Cloud services
- Monitoring tools
- CI/CD pipelines

3. Group the tech stack components into logical layers, such as:
- Frontend 
- Backend
- Databases
- Infrastructure 
- DevOps tooling

4. Within each layer, evaluate options for specific tools and services that meet the requirements. Consider factors like scalability, performance, maintainability, team familiarity, license costs, etc.

5. Narrow down to the best fit tech choices for each component and document the proposed architecture in a tech stack diagram or list.

6. Review the proposed tech stack with the team to get feedback and identify any gaps or concerns. Adjust as needed.

7. Confirm the selected tech stack aligns with and fully supports the functional and non-functional requirements of the application.

8. Document the finalized tech stack in detail, including versions, configuration, and integration points between components.

9. Have the tech stack reviewed and approved by the technical leads and architects.

10. Communicate the tech stack to the full team so everyone is on the same page regarding the technologies to be used.

The key is to let the application requirements drive the tech choices, while balancing team skills, integrations, maintainability and cost. Careful planning upfront ensures the right technologies are selected for the project.
