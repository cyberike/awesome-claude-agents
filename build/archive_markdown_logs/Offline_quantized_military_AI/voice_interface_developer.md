## Task
Voice Interface (Offline)

**Status:** completed

### Output
```
Here are the steps to create a simple voice interface that works offline:

1. Use the Web Speech API's SpeechRecognition interface to capture speech input from the user's microphone. This API is supported in modern browsers.

2. Process the speech input using the SpeechRecognition's onresult event handler. This event fires when the speech recognition service returns a result. Extract the transcript text from the results.

3. Analyze the transcript text to determine the user's intent and extract any relevant entities or parameters. You can use simple keyword matching or regular expressions for basic processing. For more advanced natural language understanding, consider using a library like Compromise.js that works offline.

4. Based on the determined intent, execute the corresponding action in your app. Update the UI, perform a calculation, retrieve data from local storage, etc.

5. To provide a voice response back to the user, use the Web Speech API's SpeechSynthesis interface. This allows you to generate synthesized speech from text.

6. Call the SpeechSynthesis.speak() method, passing it a SpeechSynthesisUtterance object containing the text you want spoken back to the user.

Here's a basic code outline:

```js
const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  
  // Process the transcript to determine intent and entities
  const intent = determineIntent(transcript);
  
  // Perform the corresponding action based on intent
  performAction(intent);
  
  // Speak a response back to the user
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Action completed');
  speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
};

recognition.start();
```

The `determineIntent` and `performAction` functions would contain your app-specific logic for processing the transcript and taking appropriate actions.

Keep in mind, the offline speech recognition and synthesis may not be as accurate or full-featured compared to online services. But this approach allows basic voice interactions without requiring network connectivity.
