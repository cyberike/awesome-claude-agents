      "output": "Here's an example implementation of a crypto donation endpoint using Node.js and Express:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst router = express.Router();\nconst Web3 = require('web3');\nconst contractABI = require('./contractABI.json');\n\n// Set up Web3 provider\nconst web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID');\n\n// Set the contract address and create contract instance\nconst contractAddress = '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890';\nconst donationContract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);\n\n// Endpoint for processing crypto donations\nrouter.post('/donate', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { from, amount } = req.body;\n\n    // Validate the input\n    if (!web3.utils.isAddress(from)) {\n      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid donor address' });\n    }\n\n    if (isNaN(amount) || amount <= 0) {\n      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid donation amount' });\n    }\n\n    // Convert the amount to wei\n    const weiAmount = web3.utils.toWei(amount.toString(), 'ether');\n\n    // Call the donate function on the smart contract\n    const result = await donationContract.methods.donate().send({\n      from,\n      value: weiAmount,\n    });\n\n    // Return the transaction hash\n    res.json({ transactionHash: result.transactionHash });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error processing donation:', error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while processing the donation' });\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We set up an Express router to handle the `/donate` endpoint.\n\n2. We initialize a Web3 instance using an Infura provider to interact with the Ethereum network. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual Infura project ID.\n\n3. We specify the contract address and create an instance of the donation contract using the contract ABI (Application Binary Interface). The contract ABI should be defined in a separate file (`contractABI.json`) and imported.\n\n4. In the `/donate` endpoint handler, we extract the `from` address (donor's address) and `amount` from the request body.\n\n5. We validate the input to ensure the donor's address is valid and the donation amount is a positive number.\n\n6. We convert the donation amount from ether to wei using `web3.utils.toWei()`.\n\n7. We call the `donate` function on the donation contract using the `send` method, passing the `from` address and the `value` (donation amount in wei).\n\n8. If the transaction is successful, we return the transaction hash in the response.\n\n9. If an error occurs during the donation process, we catch the error, log it, and return an appropriate error response.\n\nNote: This example assumes that you have a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network with a `donate` function that accepts Ether. You need to replace the `contractAddress` with the actual address of your deployed contract and ensure that the `contractABI.json` file contains the correct ABI definition for your contract.\n\nAlso, make sure to handle security aspects, such as input validation, authentication, and rate limiting, in a production environment."

      "agent": "frontend_developer",
      "status": "completed",
      "output": "To build a login screen with facial scan functionality, you'll need to use a facial recognition library or API. One popular choice is the Face Recognition library for Python. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a login screen with facial scan using Python and the Face Recognition library:\n\n1. Install the required libraries:\n   - OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`\n   - Face Recognition: `pip install face_recognition`\n\n2. Create a new Python file, e.g., `login_screen.py`.\n\n3. Import the necessary libraries:\n   ```python\n   import cv2\n   import face_recognition\n   ```\n\n4. Load the reference image of the authorized user:\n   ```python\n   reference_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"authorized_user.jpg\")\n   reference_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(reference_image)[0]\n   ```\n   Replace `\"authorized_user.jpg\"` with the path to the image of the authorized user.\n\n5. Initialize the video capture:\n   ```python\n   video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)\n   ```\n   This assumes you're using the default webcam. If you have multiple cameras, you can specify the camera index accordingly.\n\n6. Create a loop to continuously capture frames from the camera:\n   ```python\n   while True:\n       ret, frame = video_capture.read()\n       rgb_frame = frame[:, :, ::-1]\n   \n       face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_frame)\n       face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(rgb_frame, face_locations)\n   \n       for face_encoding in face_encodings:\n           matches = face_recognition.compare_faces([reference_encoding], face_encoding)\n   \n           if True in matches:\n               print(\"Access granted!\")\n               # Perform login actions here\n               break\n       else:\n           print(\"Access denied!\")\n   \n       cv2.imshow('Login Screen', frame)\n   \n       if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):\n           break\n   \n   video_capture.release()\n   cv2.destroyAllWindows()\n   ```\n   This loop does the following:\n   - Captures a frame from the camera.\n   - Converts the frame from BGR to RGB color space.\n   - Detects faces in the frame using `face_recognition.face_locations()`.\n   - Computes face encodings for the detected faces using `face_recognition.face_encodings()`.\n   - Compares the face encodings with the reference encoding of the authorized user using `face_recognition.compare_faces()`.\n   - If a match is found, it grants access and performs login actions (you need to implement this part based on your specific requirements).\n   - If no match is found, it denies access.\n   - Displays the frame with the login screen.\n   - Exits the loop when the 'q' key is pressed.\n\n7. Run the Python script:\n   ```\n   python login_screen.py\n   ```\n   This will start the login screen with facial scan functionality. When a face is detected that matches the authorized user, it will grant access. Otherwise, it will deny access.\n\nNote: Make sure to provide an appropriate reference image of the authorized user in step 4. You can capture and save an image of the authorized user beforehand.\n\nRemember to handle any necessary error handling, such as camera availability, file paths, etc., based on your specific setup and requirements."

You can replace the `qr-code.png` with an actual QR code image that represents your cryptocurrency wallet address.\n\nNote that this is just a static HTML/CSS template and doesn't include any functionality for processing the donation or integrating with a cryptocurrency payment gateway. You would need to add JavaScript and server-side code to handle the form submission, generate the QR code dynamically, and integrate with a payment processor to complete the donation process."

Choose a verification method:\n   - Email verification: Send a verification link to the user's email address.\n   - SMS verification: Send a verification code to the user's phone number.\n   - Two-factor authentication (2FA): Use a combination of password and a second factor like an authenticator app or hardware token.\n\n2. Create a user model:\n   - Define a `User` model with fields like `username`, `email`, `password`, and `isVerified`.\n   - Add a field to store the verification token or code.\n\n3. User registration:\n   - Create a registration form to collect user details.\n   - Hash and salt the user's password before storing it in the database.\n   - Generate a unique verification token or code for the user.\n   - Save the user details and verification token/code in the database.\n\n4. Send verification message:\n   - If using email verification:\n     - Create an email template with a verification link containing the user's verification token.\n     - Send the email to the user's registered email address.\n   - If using SMS verification:\n     - Integrate with an SMS service provider to send the verification code to the user's phone number.\n\n5. Verification endpoint:\n   - Create an API endpoint for verification.\n   - When the user clicks the verification link or submits the verification code, validate it against the stored token/code in the database.\n   - If the token/code is valid, mark the user as verified in the database.\n\n6. User login:\n   - During login, check if the user's account is verified.\n   - If the account is not verified, prompt the user to complete the verification process.\n   - If the account is verified, proceed with the login process.\n\n7. Resend verification:\n   - Provide an option for users to resend the verification email or SMS if they haven't received it.\n   - Generate a new verification token/code and update it in the database.\n   - Send the new verification message to the user.\n\n8. Error handling and feedback:\n   - Handle scenarios like invalid verification tokens/codes, expired tokens, or user not found.\n   - Provide appropriate error messages and feedback to the user.\n\n9. Security considerations:\n   - Ensure that verification tokens/codes are unique and difficult to guess.\n   - Set an expiration time for verification tokens to limit their validity.\n   - Protect against brute-force attacks by implementing rate limiting or CAPTCHA.\n\n10. Testing:\n    - Write unit tests to verify the functionality of user registration, verification, and login flows.\n    - Test edge cases and error scenarios to ensure proper handling.\n\nRemember to choose the verification method that best suits your application's requirements and security needs. Additionally, make sure to follow security best practices and protect sensitive user information throughout the verification process.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if you need assistance with the implementation of any specific subtask!"
