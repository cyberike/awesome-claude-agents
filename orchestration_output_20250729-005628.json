The next steps would be to flesh out the API spec in more detail, define the data models, and start implementing each module.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the design!"

We set up an Express router to handle the donation endpoint.\n\n2. We initialize a Web3 instance using an Infura provider. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual Infura project ID.\n\n3. We define the Ethereum address (`donationAddress`) where the donations will be sent.\n\n4. We create a POST endpoint `/donate` to handle incoming donation requests.\n\n5. Inside the endpoint handler, we extract the `from` address (the donor's Ethereum address) and the `amount` (in Ether) from the request body.\n\n6. We perform basic input validation to ensure the `from` address is a valid Ethereum address and the `amount` is a positive number.\n\n7. We convert the `amount` from Ether to Wei using `web3.utils.toWei()`.\n\n8. We create a transaction object with the `from` address, `to` address (the donation address), and the `value` (in Wei).\n\n9. We send the transaction using `web3.eth.sendTransaction()` and wait for the transaction receipt.\n\n10. Finally, we return the transaction receipt as the response.\n\nMake sure to install the required dependencies (`express` and `web3`) before running the code.\n\nNote: This is a basic example and doesn't include advanced features like error handling, authentication, or handling different cryptocurrencies. You may need to expand and customize the code based on your specific requirements."

        "output": "Here's a high-level outline of how you could build a login screen with facial scan functionality:\n\n1. Create the UI for the login screen\n- Add fields for username/email and password \n- Include a button to initiate the facial scan login\n- Display a live camera preview \n\n2. Implement facial recognition\n- Use a facial recognition library/SDK (like Google ML Kit, Apple Vision, OpenCV, etc)\n- When facial scan button is tapped, capture the user's face from the live camera preview \n- Extract facial features and generate a face embedding/template\n- Compare the captured face to registered face templates to find a match\n- If a match is found, authenticate the user\n\n3. Handle facial recognition events\n- Show a spinner while facial recognition is processing\n- If a match is found, log the user in and navigate to the main part of the app\n- If no match, show an error message that the face is not recognized\n- Handle other errors like no face detected, multiple faces, etc.\n\n4. Provide an enrollment flow for facial recognition \n- Allow the user to enroll their face during initial app setup or via settings\n- Capture their face, generate a face template, and securely store it on the device\n- Associate the face template with their user account\n\n5. Offer traditional login as a fallback\n- The username/email and password fields allow users to skip facial recognition \n- Useful if facial recognition fails or the user prefers not to use it\n\n6. Test the facial recognition in different scenarios \n- Different lighting conditions, angles, partial face obstruction, etc.\n- Ensure performance is acceptable and reliable\n\nThat outlines the key pieces needed for a login screen with facial scan. The facial recognition piece requires carefully selecting an appropriate library/SDK for your platform and use case. And special care must be taken to secure the stored face templates. But this should give you a solid starting point to implement this functionality.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!"

The form submission is handled by the `handleSubmit` function, which currently logs the form data to the console. You can modify this function to send the data to a server or process the donation as needed.\n\nThe component is styled using Tailwind CSS classes to provide a clean and responsive layout. You can further customize the styles by modifying the class names or adding additional CSS rules.\n\nRemember to install the necessary dependencies (React and Tailwind CSS) and set up your development environment before using this code."

        "output": "To implement user verification, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add a `verified` field to the user model:\n   ```python\n   # models.py\n   class User(models.Model):\n       # ...\n       verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n   ```\n\n2. Create a unique verification token for each user upon registration:\n   ```python\n   # views.py\n   import uuid\n\n   def register(request):\n       # ...\n       if form.is_valid():\n           user = form.save(commit=False)\n           user.verified = False\n           user.save()\n           \n           # Generate unique verification token\n           token = str(uuid.uuid4())\n           \n           # Save the token in the database\n           VerificationToken.objects.create(user=user, token=token)\n           \n           # Send verification email to the user\n           send_verification_email(user.email, token)\n           \n           # ...\n   ```\n\n3. Create a `VerificationToken` model to store verification tokens:\n   ```python\n   # models.py\n   class VerificationToken(models.Model):\n       user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n       token = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)\n       created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n   ```\n\n4. Implement the `send_verification_email` function to send the verification email:\n   ```python\n   # utils.py\n   from django.core.mail import send_mail\n   from django.template.loader import render_to_string\n   from django.utils.html import strip_tags\n\n   def send_verification_email(email, token):\n       subject = 'Verify Your Email'\n       html_message = render_to_string('verification_email.html', {'token': token})\n       plain_message = strip_tags(html_message)\n       from_email = 'your_email@example.com'\n       to_email = email\n       \n       send_mail(subject, plain_message, from_email, [to_email], html_message=html_message)\n   ```\n\n5. Create a view to handle email verification:\n   ```python\n   # views.py\n   def verify_email(request, token):\n       try:\n           verification_token = VerificationToken.objects.get(token=token)\n           user = verification_token.user\n           user.verified = True\n           user.save()\n           verification_token.delete()\n           return redirect('login')\n       except VerificationToken.DoesNotExist:\n           return HttpResponse('Invalid verification token.')\n   ```\n\n6. Add a URL pattern for email verification:\n   ```python\n   # urls.py\n   urlpatterns = [\n       # ...\n       path('verify-email/<str:token>/', views.verify_email, name='verify_email'),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n7. Create an HTML template for the verification email:\n   ```html\n   <!-- verification_email.html -->\n   <h1>Verify Your Email</h1>\n   <p>Please click the link below to verify your email address:</p>\n   <a href=\"{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'verify_email' token %}\">Verify Email</a>\n   ```\n\nWith these steps, users will receive a verification email upon registration. They can click the verification link in the email to verify their account. The `verified` field in the user model will be set to `True` once the email is verified.\n\nRemember to configure your email settings in the Django settings file to enable sending emails."
