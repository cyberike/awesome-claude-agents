The endpoint expects the following parameters in the request body:\n- `amount`: The amount of the donation.\n- `currency`: The cryptocurrency currency code (e.g., BTC, ETH).\n- `address`: The recipient's cryptocurrency wallet address.\n\nHere's how the endpoint works:\n1. It validates the input data to ensure all required fields are present.\n2. It generates a unique transaction ID using the `crypto` module.\n3. It makes a request to a hypothetical cryptocurrency payment gateway API, passing the necessary transaction details.\n4. If the payment gateway responds with a success status, it assumes the donation was received successfully. You can store the transaction details in your database for record-keeping.\n5. It sends a response back to the client indicating the success or failure of the donation.\n\nNote: This is just a simplified example, and you would need to integrate with an actual cryptocurrency payment gateway API to process real donations. Additionally, you should handle error cases, implement proper security measures, and follow best practices for handling financial transactions.\n\nRemember to install the required dependencies (`express`, `crypto`, and `axios`) before running the code."

        "output": "To build a login screen with facial scan functionality, you'll need to use a facial recognition library or API. One popular option is the Face Recognition library for Python. Here's a step-by-step guide to create a login screen with facial scan using Python and the Face Recognition library:\n\n1. Install the required libraries:\n   - Install Python on your system if you haven't already.\n   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Face Recognition library:\n     ```\n     pip install face_recognition\n     ```\n   - Install any additional dependencies like OpenCV for image processing:\n     ```\n     pip install opencv-python\n     ```\n\n2. Capture and encode the user's face:\n   - Use OpenCV to capture an image of the user's face during the registration process.\n   - Load the captured image using the Face Recognition library.\n   - Extract the facial features and encode them into a numerical representation.\n   - Store the encoded face along with the corresponding user information in a database or file.\n\n3. Create the login screen:\n   - Design a graphical user interface (GUI) for the login screen using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.\n   - Include a button or option to initiate the facial scan.\n\n4. Implement the facial scan functionality:\n   - When the user initiates the facial scan, use OpenCV to capture a live video stream from the camera.\n   - Continuously capture frames from the video stream.\n   - For each frame, detect faces using the Face Recognition library.\n   - Compare the detected face with the stored encoded faces in the database or file.\n   - If a match is found, grant access and proceed to the next screen or perform the desired action.\n   - If no match is found or multiple faces are detected, display an appropriate error message.\n\n5. Integrate the facial scan with the login process:\n   - Combine the facial scan functionality with the traditional login process (e.g., username and password).\n   - Allow the user to choose between facial scan or manual login.\n   - If the facial scan is successful, bypass the manual login step.\n\n6. Test and refine:\n   - Thoroughly test the facial scan login functionality with different users and scenarios.\n   - Fine-tune the facial recognition parameters if needed to improve accuracy and performance.\n   - Handle edge cases, such as poor lighting conditions or multiple faces in the frame.\n\nHere's a simplified code snippet to give you an idea of how the facial scan login can be implemented:\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\nimport cv2\n\n# Load the stored encoded faces and corresponding user information\nstored_faces = load_encoded_faces_from_database()\n\n# Capture a frame from the video stream\nvideo_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)\nret, frame = video_capture.read()\n\n# Detect faces in the frame\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(frame)\nface_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(frame, face_locations)\n\n# Compare the detected face with stored faces\nfor face_encoding in face_encodings:\n    matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(stored_faces, face_encoding)\n    if True in matches:\n        # Face matched, grant access\n        grant_access()\n    else:\n        # Face not matched, deny access\n        deny_access()\n```\n\nRemember to handle user registration, store encoded faces securely, and integrate this facial scan functionality into your overall login process.\n\nNote: Implementing a robust and secure facial recognition system can be complex and may require additional considerations such as lighting conditions, multiple angles, and potential spoofing attempts. It's recommended to use well-established libraries or APIs and follow best practices for security and user privacy."

Here's how it works:\n\n1. The HTML structure defines a heading (`<h1>`) for the page title \"Crypto Donation\".\n\n2. The donation form is contained within a `<div>` element with the class \"donation-container\". This container is centered on the page and has a maximum width of 400 pixels.\n\n3. The donation form itself is created using the `<form>` element with the class \"donation-form\".\n\n4. Inside the form, there are three input fields:\n   - \"Donation Amount\" (`<input type=\"text\">`): Allows the user to enter the donation amount.\n   - \"Select Cryptocurrency\" (`<select>`): Provides a dropdown menu for the user to choose the desired cryptocurrency for the donation. The options include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB).\n   - \"Wallet Address\" (`<input type=\"text\">`): Allows the user to enter the recipient's wallet address.\n\n5. The \"Donate\" button (`<button type=\"submit\">`) is used to submit the donation form.\n\n6. The CSS styles are defined within the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. These styles include:\n   - Setting the font family and margin/padding for the body.\n   - Centering the heading text.\n   - Styling the donation container with a background color, padding, and border radius.\n   - Arranging the form elements vertically using flexbox.\n   - Styling the input fields and select dropdown with padding, margins, and border styles.\n   - Styling the donate button with a background color, text color,"

        "agent": "security_engineer",
        "status": "completed",
        "output": "To implement user verification, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add a `verified` field to the `User` model:\n\n```python\nclass User(models.Model):\n    # ...existing fields...\n    verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n```\n\n2. Create a unique verification token for each user upon registration. We can use the `uuid` library to generate a unique token:\n\n```python\nimport uuid\n\ndef generate_verification_token():\n    return str(uuid.uuid4())\n```\n\n3. Store the verification token in the database, associated with the user. Add a `verification_token` field to the `User` model:\n\n```python\nclass User(models.Model):\n    # ...existing fields...\n    verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n    verification_token = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)\n```\n\n4. When a user registers, generate a verification token and save it along with the user's details:\n\n```python\ndef register_user(request):\n    # ...existing registration logic...\n    user = User(username=username, email=email, verified=False)\n    user.set_password(password)\n    user.verification_token = generate_verification_token()\n    user.save()\n    # ...\n```\n\n5. Send a verification email to the user's registered email address. The email should include a unique verification link that contains the verification token. You can use Django's email functionality to send the email.\n\n6. Create a view to handle the verification process when the user clicks on the verification link:\n\n```python\ndef verify_user(request, token):\n    try:\n        user = User.objects.get(verification_token=token)\n        user.verified = True\n        user.verification_token = None  # Clear the token after verification\n        user.save()\n        # Redirect to a success page or login page\n        return redirect('verification_success')\n    except User.DoesNotExist:\n        # Handle invalid or expired token\n        return redirect('verification_failed')\n```\n\n7. Update the login view to check if the user is verified before allowing them to log in:\n\n```python\ndef login_user(request):\n    # ...existing login logic...\n    user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)\n    if user is not None:\n        if user.verified:\n            login(request, user)\n            # Redirect to a success page or dashboard\n            return redirect('dashboard')\n        else:\n            # Display an error message indicating that the user is not verified\n            error_message = 'Your account is not verified. Please check your email for the verification link.'\n    else:\n        # Handle invalid credentials\n        error_message = 'Invalid username or password.'\n    # ...\n```\n\n8. Create templates for the verification success and failure pages.\n\nWith these steps, users will receive a verification email upon registration, and they will need to click on the verification link to verify their account before being able to log in.\n\nRemember to handle cases such as resending the verification email if the user doesn't receive it or requests a new one, and provide appropriate error messages and feedback to the user throughout the verification process."
