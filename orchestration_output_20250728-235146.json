API gateway receives image via /enroll or /recognize endpoint\n2. Image passed to Face Detection to locate faces\n3. Detected faces passed to Face Encoding to generate embeddings \n4. Face embeddings passed to Face Matching\n  - If enrolling, stores new embedding and person metadata\n  - If recognizing, compares to existing embeddings to find matches\n5. Recognition results or new person ID returned in API response\n6. Key events and metrics logged for monitoring and improvements\n\nSecurity considerations:\n- Authenticate and authorize API clients \n- Encrypt data in transit and at rest\n- Protect against common web vulnerabilities \n- Comply with relevant privacy regulations\n```\n\nThis outlines the key API endpoints, system components, workflow, and security considerations at a high level. The actual implementation would require selecting specific algorithms, databases, etc. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the design."

      "output": "To implement a crypto donation endpoint, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up a cryptocurrency wallet:\n   - Choose a cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) that you want to accept for donations.\n   - Create a wallet address for receiving the donations.\n   - Ensure the wallet is secure and accessible only by authorized personnel.\n\n2. Create an API endpoint:\n   - Implement an API endpoint in your backend server to handle the donation requests.\n   - The endpoint should accept the necessary parameters such as the donation amount, cryptocurrency type, and any additional metadata.\n   - Example endpoint: `POST /api/donations/crypto`\n\n3. Process the donation request:\n   - When a donation request is received, validate the input parameters.\n   - Generate a unique donation address or invoice for each donation request.\n   - Store the donation details (amount, cryptocurrency, timestamp, status) in your database.\n   - Respond with the generated donation address or invoice to the client.\n\n4. Monitor and update donation status:\n   - Regularly check the blockchain for incoming transactions to the generated donation addresses.\n   - When a transaction is confirmed, update the corresponding donation status in your database.\n   - Notify the donor and perform any necessary actions (e.g., sending a thank you email, updating donation totals).\n\n5. Handle errors and edge cases:\n   - Implement proper error handling for invalid requests, network issues, or wallet-related errors.\n   - Consider handling cases like insufficient funds, double-spending attempts, or expired donation addresses.\n\n6. Integrate with a cryptocurrency payment processor (optional):\n   - If you want to simplify the process, you can integrate with a cryptocurrency payment processor like Coinbase Commerce or BitPay.\n   - These services handle the wallet management, address generation, and transaction monitoring for you.\n   - You'll need to follow their API documentation to integrate their payment gateway into your endpoint.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how the API endpoint might look like using Express.js:\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/api/donations/crypto', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { amount, cryptocurrency } = req.body;\n\n    // Validate input parameters\n    if (!amount || !cryptocurrency) {\n      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Amount and cryptocurrency are required' });\n    }\n\n    // Generate a unique donation address or invoice\n    const donationAddress = generateDonationAddress(cryptocurrency);\n\n    // Store the donation details in the database\n    await storeDonationDetails(amount, cryptocurrency, donationAddress);\n\n    // Respond with the donation address or invoice\n    res.json({ donationAddress });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error processing donation:', error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while processing the donation' });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nRemember to handle security, validation, and error handling properly in your actual implementation. Additionally, make sure to comply with any legal and regulatory requirements related to accepting cryptocurrency donations."

      "output": "To build a login screen with facial scan functionality, you'll need to use a facial recognition library or API. One popular option is the Face Recognition library for Python. Here's a step-by-step guide to create a login screen with facial scan using Python and the Face Recognition library:\n\n1. Install the required libraries:\n   - OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`\n   - Face Recognition: `pip install face_recognition`\n\n2. Create a Python script, e.g., `login_screen.py`, and add the following code:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport face_recognition\n\n# Load the known face encodings\nknown_face_encodings = [\n    # Add the encodings of the authorized faces here\n]\n\n# Load the corresponding names\nknown_face_names = [\n    # Add the names corresponding to the encodings here\n]\n\n# Initialize the video capture\nvideo_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)\n\nwhile True:\n    # Capture a frame from the video stream\n    ret, frame = video_capture.read()\n\n    # Convert the frame from BGR to RGB\n    rgb_frame = frame[:, :, ::-1]\n\n    # Find the face locations and encodings in the current frame\n    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_frame)\n    face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(rgb_frame, face_locations)\n\n    # Iterate over the detected faces\n    for face_encoding in face_encodings:\n        # Compare the face encoding with the known encodings\n        matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(known_face_encodings, face_encoding)\n\n        # Check if a match is found\n        if True in matches:\n            # Get the index of the matched face\n            match_index = matches.index(True)\n            name = known_face_names[match_index]\n            print(f\"Access granted for {name}\")\n            # Perform login actions here\n            break\n    else:\n        print(\"Access denied. Unknown face.\")\n\n    # Display the frame\n    cv2.imshow('Login Screen', frame)\n\n    # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed\n    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):\n        break\n\n# Release the video capture and close windows\nvideo_capture.release()\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\n3. Replace the `known_face_encodings` and `known_face_names` lists with the encodings and names of the authorized faces. You can generate the encodings using the `face_recognition.face_encodings()` function by providing images of the authorized faces.\n\n4. Run the script using `python login_screen.py`.\n\n5. The script will open a window showing the video stream from your webcam. When a face is detected, it will compare the face encoding with the known encodings. If a match is found, it will grant access and display the name of the authorized person. If no match is found, it will deny access.\n\n6. Press 'q' to quit the program.\n\nNote: Make sure you have a webcam connected to your computer for the facial scan to work.\n\nThis is a basic implementation of a login screen with facial scan using Python and the Face Recognition library. You can further enhance it by integrating it with a graphical user interface (GUI) library like Tkinter or PyQt for a more user-friendly experience."

The form is styled using CSS to provide a clean and user-friendly interface.\n\nYou can further enhance the functionality by adding JavaScript to handle form submission, integrate with a payment gateway or crypto wallet, and implement validation and error handling.\n\nRemember to replace the cryptocurrency options with the ones you plan to support and customize the styling to match your desired design."

When the user submits the registration form, validate the input data on the server-side to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., username and email are unique, password is strong enough).\n\n3. If the registration data is valid, store the user's information securely in the database. Hash the password using a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt before storing it.\n\n4. Send a verification email to the user's registered email address. The email should contain a unique verification link or code.\n\n5. When the user clicks on the verification link or enters the verification code, mark the user's account as verified in the database.\n\n6. During the login process, check if the user's account is verified.
